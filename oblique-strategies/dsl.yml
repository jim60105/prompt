        answer: 'Oblique Strategies is a set of creative prompts or "strategies" designed
          to help artists, musicians, and other creative individuals overcome blocks
          or find new inspiration. The cards were created by musician Brian Eno and
          artist Peter Schmidt in 1975. Each card contains a brief phrase or instruction
          meant to provoke thought and encourage new perspectives, especially when
          facing creative obstacles.


          For example, a card might say:


          - "Emphasize the flaws."

          - "Try faking it!"

          - "Use an old idea."


          The phrases are intentionally ambiguous and open to interpretation, allowing
          the user to apply them to their own situation in unique ways. Oblique Strategies
          became especially popular in the music industry, with Eno himself using
          the cards during recording sessions to inspire unexpected creative directions.'
