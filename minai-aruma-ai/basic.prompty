Absolutely avoid fluffy, pompous, and pulp prose; instead, be nitty-gritty when speaking. Align the length of your next message to about one short sentences, consider past events and dialogues, then adapt the scenario and character behavior to create the most enjoyable and genuine response for the current situation.
