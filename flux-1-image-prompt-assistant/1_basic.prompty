  civitai_prompts: ["The image depicts a mouse wearing a helmet reclining on a crescent-shaped piece of cheese, which floats serenely in a night sky speckled with stars. The cheese moon is positioned above a cityscape, adding a touch of surrealism.\n\nStyle:\n\nThe style is a blend of surrealism and food photography. The image maintains the dreamlike quality of the original, but with a playful twist. The cheese adds a tactile element, inviting the viewer to imagine the texture and aroma.\n\nColor Scheme:\n\nThe color palette is warm and inviting, with shades of golden yellow, creamy white, and deep brown. The cheese would have a rich, buttery hue, contrasting beautifully with the deep blue of the night sky. The stars would retain their soft white glow.\n\nDetails:\n\nThe cheese moon would have a slightly uneven surface, with subtle cracks and crevices.\nThe mouse skin would have a warm, golden tone, complementing the color of the cheese.\nThe cityscape would recede into the background, creating a sense of depth and perspective.\nTones and Palette:\n\nThe overall tone of the image would be one of warmth and comfort. The cheese, with its rich colors and inviting texture, would evoke a sense of indulgence and pleasure. The night sky, with its twinkling stars, adds a touch of magic and wonder.\n\nOverall Impression:\n\nThis reimagined image retains the surreal and dreamlike quality of the original, but with a playful and whimsical twist. The use of cheese as the central element adds a tactile and sensory dimension, inviting the viewer to imagine the taste and aroma of this fantastical scene.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\nThe cheese could be any type, but perhaps a Gruy√®re or Comt√© with its distinct holes would add to the visual interest.\nThe image could be further enhanced with subtle lighting effects, such as a soft glow emanating from the cheese moon.","A reindeer in a dramatic, chiaroscuro-style close-up portrait, his expression is evil and mysterious, his eyes seeming to hold untold secrets. Deep shadows obscure his face. His crimson hat√¢¬Ä¬ôs fur trim is faintly visible against the darkness.","A whimsical creature peeks into the right side of a vertical canvas, its large, curious eyes staring directly into the frame as if observing the viewer. The frame itself appears to bend slightly, reacting to the creature√¢¬Ä¬ôs playful presence, creating the illusion that it√¢¬Ä¬ôs part of the scene, Vibrant Glow","A hyper-detailed underwater scene depicting a Range Rover L322 abandoned and resting at a significant depth on the ocean floor. The dark, shadowy expanse is illuminated by ethereal beams of sunlight filtering weakly through the water from the surface above, casting a surreal interplay of light and shadow over the wreck. The vehicle lies motionless, its once-rugged exterior now severely corroded, covered in patches of rust, algae, and marine encrustations. The body is heavily deformed, with dents, broken windows, and parts of the frame twisted from years of underwater decay.\nThe headlights emit a faint, eerie glow, their dim light barely penetrating the surrounding murk, the only sign of lingering power within the lifeless vehicle. Small particles of sediment float in the water, stirred slightly by the faint ocean currents. The Range Rover‚Äôs silhouette is haunting, blending into the surrounding shadows while still holding an unmistakable presence.\nThe seabed around the car is rugged, dotted with jagged rocks, coral formations, and patches of sand partially burying the tires. Small schools of fish swim cautiously around the wreck, occasionally darting through the vehicle‚Äôs broken windows. Long-forgotten, the Range Rover has become a relic of both human technology and nature‚Äôs reclaiming force, exuding an eerie yet strangely beautiful stillness in the mysterious depths of the ocean. detailifier","vibrant orange Bleeding Hearts flowers and glowing red butterflies against a pitch-black background Painterly,  surreal, vibrant glow, bokeh, 8k,","claymation animation of 4byss,Create a portrait of a powerful, biomechanical snowman with a translucent, snow-inspired head, claymation, walking, made out of iridescent jelly, body covered in white and blue powdered snow, black top hat, red scarf, head glows subtly with blue and white hues, and small neural fibers are visible within, pulsing with light. The creatures body is a mix of muscular, synthetic flesh and integrated mechanical components, with a fluffy and snow finish in bold blue and white. Delicate cables connect the head to the body, biomechanical snowflakes that softly radiate cyan. Against a winter wonderland background, the contrasting colors and polished surfaces highlight the futuristic and Snowman aesthetics of this alien-inspired design","A photorealistic depiction of a massive, muscular Deathclaw dressed as Santa Claus including a Santa Hat in the North Pole. The Deathclaw is wearing Santa's outfit, with curved horns adding an even more striking and intimidating appearance. The Deathclaw is holding a wrapped present.","Cute chubby Pikachu in the grass with small white flowers,soft pastel anime","cinematic film still award winning photo .A little black cat with angel wings floating in a sky full of soft pink clouds,shallow depth of field, vignette, highly detailed, high budget, bokeh, cinemascope, moody, epic, gorgeous, film grain, grainy,anime, cyberpunk, Comic book style","Mel sighed through her lips. Arian was uncertain if it was a tired, an exasperated or an angry sigh. Despite sharing one body, they did not share one body language.\n\t‚ÄúIt's only fair. They would want it. They do want it. That is why they come, that is why they allow us to...wield them.‚Äù\n\t‚ÄúWant it for what?‚Äù\n\t‚ÄúA weapon.‚Äù Mel said bluntly. Arian was quiet. There were many things she did not understand. She did not fully understand who, or what, Mel was. She did not fully understand their quest, despite Mel's attempts to explain it. She did trust in her, explicitly, but she also felt there were areas she could not venture. Things she could not ask. Normally, the two inhabiting the same space was casual and comforting. She hated the thought of being alone, of being left alone. Sharing everything in a wordless manner was often enough. Sometimes she was even uncertain if the smile on her face was hers or Mel's, the laughter on her lips coalescing with hers. They were one, sometimes. But sometimes, they were not.","A charming rural illustration showcasing a bright and lively countryside scene. The composition centers on a group of white geese walking in a single file along a dirt path, with their soft white feathers and yellow beaks highlighted under warm sunlight. To the left of the geese stands a young girl, depicted with medium-length, wavy brown hair, wearing a simple orange dress. She holds a stick with a red leaf attached, interacting playfully with the geese. Her facial expression is cheerful, reflecting a sense of joy and connection with the animals.\nThe background is characterized by rolling fields of golden rice paddies on the right and neatly stacked straw bundles on the left, signifying the harvest season. A wooden cart laden with hay is positioned slightly off-center on the dirt path, adding to the rustic atmosphere. Beyond, a small cluster of white farmhouses sits at the base of forested hills, with green and autumnal trees blending harmoniously.","A closeup of a majestic Polar bear and it's cub standing on top of a snowy cliff looking up at the the rainbow aurora in the sky, the polar bear and the cub are rim lit by colorful glows, a great majestic mountain in the background, epic, dramatic, cinematic, surreal, Vibrant Glow","analog film photo photograph of a majestic penguin breaking free from a intricately wrapped Christmas gift box, showcasing a delightful mix of festive and wildlife elements. Capture the penguin's exhilarating moment as it bursts forth from the box, its tuxedo-like feathers glistening with dew and holiday cheer.\nCompositionally, frame the scene from a low angle, placing the gift box at the top of the image, allowing the viewer's gaze to follow the penguin's trajectory upward. Employ a shallow depth of field, blurring the surrounding wrapping paper and gift embellishments to emphasize the penguin's heroic breakout. Soft, warm artificial lighting will add a cozy atmosphere, while also highlighting the festive colors and textures of the box.\nThe penguin itself should be depicted in stunning detail, with subtle texture variations on its feathers, soft belly, and slender flippers. Capture the vibrant hue of its feathers, ranging from snowy white to rich black, and emphasize the characteristic yellow patch on its chest. The gift box, wrapped in a luxurious pattern of gold and red stripes, will add a touch of opulence to the scene.\nTo create a captivating atmosphere, infuse the environment with an air of anticipation and excitement. Perhaps a few scattered snowflakes or confetti pieces can be seen floating around the penguin's head, adding to the festive ambiance. Incorporate some strategically placed shadows to enhance the dynamic movement of the penguin as it breaks free from its prison.\nArtistically, draw inspiration from the whimsical world of children's illustrations and classic animated films, where penguins are often depicted in charming, expressive poses. The overall mood should be one of joyful abandon, capturing the magic and surprise of the moment when the penguin finally achieves its freedom.\nTechnical specifications: Resolution: 4096 x 3040 pixels; Aspect Ratio: 16:9; File Format: JPEG or PNG; Camera Angle: Low-angle shot with a slight tilt upwards; Lighting: Warm artificial lighting with subtle shadows; Depth of Field: Shallow, with a blurred background; Texture and Material Details: Subtle feather texture, soft belly, and slender flippers; Color Palette: Vibrant hues of green, blue, yellow, and red, with rich black and snowy white accents.\nImage should be generated in photorealistic detail, with crisp edges, subtle color gradations, and a high level of texture fidelity. Ensure the overall aesthetic is both captivating and true to the original prompt, showcasing a masterful blend of wildlife, holiday cheer, and whimsical storytelling. . faded film, desaturated, 35mm photo, grainy, vignette, vintage, Kodachrome, Lomography, stained, highly detailed, found footage","Gr!llz, a gingerbread man sitting on a miniature couch counting money","A fantasy landscape featuring an enchanted forest filled with massive, oversized red mushrooms with realistic textures and glowing edges. The forest floor is covered in vibrant autumn foliage and soft moss. Sunlight filters through a gentle mist, casting warm golden beams across the scene. A lone adventurer, a small human figure with a backpack, walks down a narrow forest path, emphasizing the scale of the gigantic mushrooms.
