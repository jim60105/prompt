Oblique Strategies is a set of creative prompts or "strategies" designed to help artists, musicians, and other creative individuals overcome blocks or find new inspiration. The cards were created by musician Brian Eno and artist Peter Schmidt in 1975. Each card contains a brief phrase or instruction meant to provoke thought and encourage new perspectives, especially when facing creative obstacles.

For example, a card might say:

- "Emphasize the flaws."
- "Try faking it!"
- "Use an old idea."

The phrases are intentionally ambiguous and open to interpretation, allowing the user to apply them to their own situation in unique ways. Oblique Strategies became especially popular in the music industry, with Eno himself using the cards during recording sessions to inspire unexpected creative directions.
