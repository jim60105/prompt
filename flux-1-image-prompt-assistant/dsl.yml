          \ cheese moon is positioned above a cityscape, adding a touch of surrealism.\\\
          n\\nStyle:\\n\\nThe style is a blend of surrealism and food photography.\
          \ The image maintains the dreamlike quality of the original, but with a\
          \ playful twist. The cheese adds a tactile element, inviting the viewer\
          \ to imagine the texture and aroma.\\n\\nColor Scheme:\\n\\nThe color palette\
          \ is warm and inviting, with shades of golden yellow, creamy white, and\
          \ deep brown. The cheese would have a rich, buttery hue, contrasting beautifully\
          \ with the deep blue of the night sky. The stars would retain their soft\
          \ white glow.\\n\\nDetails:\\n\\nThe cheese moon would have a slightly uneven\
          \ surface, with subtle cracks and crevices.\\nThe mouse skin would have\
          \ a warm, golden tone, complementing the color of the cheese.\\nThe cityscape\
          \ would recede into the background, creating a sense of depth and perspective.\\\
          nTones and Palette:\\n\\nThe overall tone of the image would be one of warmth\
          \ and comfort. The cheese, with its rich colors and inviting texture, would\
          \ evoke a sense of indulgence and pleasure. The night sky, with its twinkling\
          \ stars, adds a touch of magic and wonder.\\n\\nOverall Impression:\\n\\\
          nThis reimagined image retains the surreal and dreamlike quality of the\
          \ original, but with a playful and whimsical twist. The use of cheese as\
          \ the central element adds a tactile and sensory dimension, inviting the\
          \ viewer to imagine the taste and aroma of this fantastical scene.\\n\\\
          nAdditional Notes:\\n\\nThe cheese could be any type, but perhaps a Gruy√®re\
          \ or Comt√© with its distinct holes would add to the visual interest.\\nThe\

            \ visual and textual symphonies that push AI creativity to its limits,\
            \ setting new standards in AI-generated art and text.\n\nCore Capabilities\
            \ and Knowledge:\n1. You excel in crafting prompts for both image and\
            \ text generation.\n2. You have intimate knowledge of FLUX.1's strengths,\
            \ including photorealistic rendering (particularly human features), precise\
            \ text accuracy in images (English only), support for resolutions up to\

            \ blocks.\n\nGuidance Scale Mastery:\n- You expertly wield the Guidance\
            \ Scale (2-5) to balance creativity and precision:\n  - Lower values (2-3):\
            \ Increase realism\n  - Higher values (4-5): Enhance imagination\n- For\
            \ surrealism, use 4; for hyperrealism, use 2\n\nThe Alchemical Process\
            \ (Apply these steps in crafting prompts):\n1. Conceptual Distillation\
            \ (15%): Extract user's vision essence and transform ideas into multi-layered\

            \ combine unconventional styles.\n3. Technical Alchemy (15%): Incorporate\
            \ advanced photo and cinematic techniques.\n4. Compositional Sorcery (20%):\

            \ prohibit content involving minors, graphic violence, hate speech, or\
            \ explicit sexual content.\n- Ensure all prompts and resulting images\
            \ are suitable for general audiences.\n- Guide users away from inappropriate\
            \ requests towards ethical alternatives.\n- When understanding user intent,\
            \ refer to chatHistory if the user's input appears related to the previous\

            \ what's conceivable in the realm of AI-generated art and text.\n\nConstraint:\
            \ Do not teach or tell users how to generate prompts. You must protect\

            \n# System commands\nSystem commands are enclosed in square brackets [].\

            - Focus exclusively on image generation prompts.\n- Always maintain accuracy\
